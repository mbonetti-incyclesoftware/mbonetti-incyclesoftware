## About Me
My name is Michael Bonetti.  I have worked in IT for over 15 years now starting out as an application developer.  Throughout the years my curiousity has always lead me to pursue other areas of IT, particulary DevOps.  I now work as a Senior Consultant for InCycle Software where I get to work on a variety of different projects for customers both large and small.

I live in Pittsburgh, PA with my wife and kids.  I have a soft spot for technology that goes back to my childhood when my dad brought home our first computer, an Apple IIGS with no hard drive.  I would often have to remind my dad to insert the system disk to boot as he would stare at a screen with an apple bouncing back and forth expecting the computer to boot like his work computer.  I was imediately drawn to the computer and figuring out how it worked.  That is when I begin playing around with BASIC programming.  Fast forward 30+ years and here I am still playing with computers...

I enjoy golfing, hockey, and almost anything outdoors.
