## About Me
My name is Michael Bonetti.  I have worked in IT for aproximately 20 years, starting out as an application developer.  Throughout the years my curiosity has always lead me to pursue other areas of IT, particularly DevOps.  I now work as a Senior Consultant for InCycle Software where I get to work on a variety of different projects for customers both large and small.

I live in Pittsburgh, PA with my wife and kids where I enjoy golfing, hockey, and almost anything outdoors.

## ðŸ”§ Languages and Technologies
I have a heavy background in C# application development and Azure architecture.  To utilize these skills to their potential, I picked up several others such as:
* DevOps best practices using both Azure DevOps and GitHub
* IaC (ARM, Bicep, Terraform)
* Database skills with SQL Server and Cosmos DB.
* Web Development with Angular and Blazor
